--
-- A data source keeps track of its state by creating an instance of
-- 'StateKey' to map the request type to its state. In this case, the
-- type of the state should probably be a reference type of some kind,
-- such as 'IORef'.
--
-- For a complete example data source, see

class CacheableSource req where
  -- | Maximum number of items of a particular request in the cache.

  cacheSize :: req a -> Maybe Int

-- The 'Show1' class is a workaround for the fact that we can't write
-- @'Show' (req a)@ as a superclass of 'DataSource', without also
-- parameterizing 'DataSource' over @a@, which is a pain (I tried
-- it). 'Show1' seems fairly benign, though.

-- | A data source can fetch data in one of two ways.
--
--   * Synchronously ('SyncFetch'): the fetching operation is an
--     @'IO' ()@ that fetches all the data and then returns.
--
--   * Asynchronously ('AsyncFetch'): we can do something else while the
--     data is being fetched. The fetching operation takes an @'IO' ()@ as
--     an argument, which is the operation to perform while the data is
--     being fetched.
--
-- See 'syncFetch' and 'asyncFetch' for example usage.
--
data PerformFetch
  = SyncFetch  (IO ())
  | AsyncFetch (IO () -> IO ())

-- Why does AsyncFetch contain a `IO () -> IO ()` rather than the
-- alternative approach of returning the `IO` action to retrieve the
-- results, which might seem better: `IO (IO ())`?  The point is that
-- this allows the data source to acquire resources for the purpose of
-- this fetching round using the standard `bracket` pattern, so it can
-- ensure that the resources acquired are properly released even if
-- other data sources fail.

-- | A 'BlockedFetch' is a pair of
--
--   * The request to fetch (with result type @a@)
--
--   * An 'MVar' to store either the result or an error
--
-- We often want to collect together multiple requests, but they return
-- different types, and the type system wouldn't let us put them
-- together in a list because all the elements of the list must have the
-- same type. So we wrap up these types inside the 'BlockedFetch' type,
-- so that they all look the same and we can put them in a list.
--
-- When we unpack the 'BlockedFetch' and get the request and the 'MVar'
-- out, the type system knows that the result type of the request
-- matches the type parameter of the 'MVar', so it will let us take the
-- result of the request and store it in the 'MVar'.
--
data BlockedFetch r = forall a. BlockedFetch (r a) (ResultVar a)

-- | Function for easily setting a fetch to a particular exception
setError :: (Exception e) => (forall a. r a -> e) -> BlockedFetch r -> IO ()
setError e (BlockedFetch req m) = putFailure m (e req)

except :: (Exception e) => e -> Either SomeException a
except = Left . toException

-- | A sink for the result of a data fetch, used by 'BlockedFetch' and the
-- 'DataCache'. Why do we need an 'MVar' here?  The reason is that the cache
-- serves two purposes:
--
--  1. To cache the results of requests that were submitted in a previous round.
--
--  2. To remember requests that have been encountered in the current round but
--     are not yet submitted, so that if we see the request again we can make
--     sure that we only submit it once.
--
-- Storing the result as an 'MVar' gives two benefits:
--
--   * We can tell the difference between (1) and (2) by testing whether the
--     'MVar' is empty. See 'Haxl.Fetch.cached'.
--
--   * In the case of (2), we don't have to update the cache again after the
--     current round, and after the round we can read the result of each request
--     from its 'MVar'. All instances of identical requests will share the same
--     'MVar' to obtain the result.
